Directions for installing `hectordata`.

Start by setting up R, following the [official instructions](https://cloud.r-project.org/) for your platform. 
To install the version associated with the current master git branch on GitHub, use the remotes::install_github function. This will automatically install all of hectordata's dependencies as well. 

```r
# If the `remotes` isn't installed, first run:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jgcri/hectordata")
```

After installing hectordata you should be able to run `library(hectordata)` in your R session.
